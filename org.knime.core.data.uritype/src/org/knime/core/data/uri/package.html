  <title>KNIME URI DataCell/PortObject representation (Pending API)</title>
</head>

<body>
<p>
During the KNIME Opensource Days 2011 we(*) agreed on the following:
- We need to have uniform URL representation in KNIME in form of a DataCell 
  (part of KNIME table) and a PortObject (custom port type)
- Both the cell and port object must represent the same content, they both
  use a delegate "URLContent" (possibly subclassed). Dedicated nodes allow the
  conversion between cells (or tables) and port objects.
- Nodes that need a URL input should use the dedicated port, not a table (though
  tables are needed, e.g. in loops etc).
- A DataCell represent a single URL, multiple URLs are represented by a table.
- A PortObject represents multiple URLs.
- A URL may have a MIMEType (really an extension only) associated. It's 
  represented by a MIMEURLContent. 
- In order to allow access to the MIME type during node configuration, the
  MIME type is also represented in a MIMEURLPortObject[Spec], which extends the
  URLPortObject[Spec]. All URLs represented by such an MIMEURLPortObject need
  to have the same MIME type.
